# Reflection:
## 1. Identify any challenges or issues you encountered while writing your functions.
- Incorrect indentation- making sure all the functions, variables and  statements are in the right block can be challenging.
- Using exception handling can be tricky expecially when you have to raise more than two errors.
- Using unit testing can be time consuming and it constantly needs to be update each time you make changes to your code. 
## 2. Discuss the benefits and challenges of developing and using unit tests.
` some benefits of unit testing are:`
- it improves the quality of your code by  testing each block of your code to identify possible errors when developing a program. 
- it can also sserve as a documentation, by clearly stating how the code is supposed to work.

` some challenges of using unit testing are:`
